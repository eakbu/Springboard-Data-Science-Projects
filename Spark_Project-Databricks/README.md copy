# Clustering Methods
------------------------
## [K-Nearest Neighbors and PCA](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/CLUSTERING)
**Key Skills**
* K-Means
* PCA - Principle Component Analysis
* Elbow Sum of Squares Method

**Mini project on customer segmentation and being able to identify different types of customers and then figure out ways to find more of those individuals so you can get more customers! The data comes from John Foreman's book Data Smart. The dataset contains both information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent) and transaction level data from customers (which offer customers responded to and what they bought).**

# Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)
--------------------------------
## [Hospital Readmittance Data](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/EDA_hospital_readmit)
## [Human Temperature Data](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/EDA_human_temperature)
## [Racial Discrimination Data](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/EDA_racial_discrimination)
**Key Skills**
* Central Limit Theorem
* Statistical Analysis
* Data Visualization
* z-test
* t-test
* Margin of Error (MOE)
* Chi-Squared Test
* Bootstrap Statistics

**Several EDA's performed on varying data categories. Hospital Readmittance performs a statistical analysis on a previously done analysis to critique its validity. Human Temperature EDA uses bootstrap statistics to determine the true average temperature of the human body in both male and females. Racial Discrimination performs a statistical analysis on if race has a meaningful impact on the callback rate of candidates who have submitted resumes to jobs of interest.**

# Machine Learning Algorithms
## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/linear_regression)
## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/logistic_regression)
## [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/naive_bayes)
**Key Skills**
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Naive Bayes

**Performing several Machine Learning Algorithms in miniprojects such as: Labeling an obersvation as either male or female based on height and weight data (Logistic Regression), Regression Price Estimate on Boston Housing data using Linear Regression, and predicting movie reviews with Naive Bayes Models**

# PYSPARK
## [MapReduce with Pyspark](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/blob/master/spark/pyspark_exercise.ipynb)

**Performing several exercises utlitizing MapReduce Pyspark (RDD) with a touch of MLlib**

**Key Skills**
* Pyspark
* RDD
* Spark Dataframes

# SQL
## [Yammer SQL Case Study](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/blob/master/SQL/Yammer%20Case%20Study/Yammer%20Case%20Study.ipynb)
**Key Skills**
* SQL 
* Time Series Analysis
* Applied Plotting and Charting

**This is a SQL case study as proposed from Mode Analytics at https://modeanalytics.com/. The Jupyter notebook in this repository is a cleaned up verison of the original case study which contains all original SQL queries, and can be found here: https://modeanalytics.com/mooseburger/reports/14cbbb5670b8**

# JSON
## [Data Wrangling with JSON](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/data_wrangling_json)

**Key Skills**
* JSON Manipulation and Extraction
* Applied Plotting and Charting

**An exercise of data extraction and exploration utilizing a JSON data source**

# Take Home Data Challenges
## [Relax Chalenge](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/blob/master/relax_challenge/Relax%20Challenge.ipynb)
## [Ultimate Challenge Parts 1 & 2](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/blob/master/ultimate_challenge/Part%201%20%26%202%20-%20Logins%20EDA%20%7C%20Statistical%20Testing.ipynb)
## [Ultimate Challange Part 3](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/blob/master/ultimate_challenge/Part%203%20-%20Ultimate%20Users%20Data.ipynb)

**Key Skills**
* Full Stack Data Scientist

**Relax Challenge** - Defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into a product on three separate days in at least one seven-day period, identify which factors predict future user adoption. You are given two datasets
1. A user table ("takehome_users") with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the product in the last two years
2. A usage summary table ("takehome_user_engagement") that has a row for each day that a user logged into the product.

**Ultimate Challenge** 
* Part   1  ‐ Exploratory data analysis 
* Part 2  ‐ Experiment   and   metrics   design 
* Part 3 - Predictive Modelling
