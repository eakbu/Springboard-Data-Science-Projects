# Clustering Methods
------------------------
## [K-Nearest Neighbors and PCA](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Clustering_Project-Customer_Segmentation)
**Key Skills**
* K-Means (Elbow Sum of Squares Method, The Silhouette Method, The Gap Statistic )
* PCA - Principle Component Analysis
* Affinity Propagation
* Spectral Clustering
* Ward's Method
* Agglomerative Clustering
* DBSCAN

**Clustering project on customer segmentation and can identify different group of customers and then consider ways to find more of those individuals so you can get more customers! The data comes from John Foreman's book Data Smart. The dataset contains both information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent) and transaction level data from customers (which offer customers responded to and what they bought).**

# Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)
--------------------------------
## [Inferential_Statistics_Frequentist](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Inferential_Statistics_Frequentist_mini-projects6.28.19)
## [Bootstrap_Inference](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Bootstrap_Inference_Mini-Project8.19)
## [Bayesian_stats](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Bayesian_stats_Q6.28)
**Key Skills**
* Central Limit Theorem
* Statistical Analysis
* Data Visualization
* z-test
* t-test
* Margin of Error (MOE)
* Bayesian Statistic
* Bootstrap Statistic


**Several EDA's performed on varying data categories. Inferential_Statistics_Frequentist_1a makes to bridge the gap between having a basic understanding of probability and random variables and being able to apply these concepts in Python. Inferential_Statistics_Frequentist_1b frequentist inference mini-project focuses on a real-world application of this type of inference to give you further practice using these concepts. Hospital Medical Charge uses EDA uses Bootstrap statistics to determine  to verify your calculations and check that you get consistent results without making the assumptions required before. Hospital Medical Charge uses Bayesian statistic to determine  its financial resiliency plan, which requires a model for revenue under a range of conditions that include the number of patients treated.**

# Machine Learning Algorithms
## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Linear_Regression_Project)
## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Logistic_Regression_Project)
## [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Naive_Bayes_Project)
**Key Skills**
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Naive Bayes

**Performing several Machine Learning Algorithms in miniprojects such as: Labeling an obersvation as either male or female based on height and weight data (Logistic Regression), Regression Price Estimate on Boston Housing data using Linear Regression, and predicting movie reviews with Naive Bayes Models**

# PYSPARK
## [MapReduce with Pyspark]()

**Performing several exercises utlitizing MapReduce Pyspark (RDD) with a touch of MLlib**

**Key Skills**
* Pyspark
* RDD
* Spark Dataframes

# SQL
## [Understanding Country Club Database with SQL ](https://github.com/eakbu/Springboard-Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/SQL_Project)
**Key Skills**
* SQL 
* Time Series Analysis
* Applied Plotting and Charting

**This is a SQL case study as proposed from Mode Analytics at https://modeanalytics.com/. The Jupyter notebook in this repository is a cleaned up verison of the original case study which contains all original SQL queries, and can be found here: https://modeanalytics.com/mooseburger/reports/14cbbb5670b8**

# JSON
## [Data Wrangling with JSON](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/data_wrangling_json)

**Key Skills**
* JSON Manipulation and Extraction
* Applied Plotting and Charting

**An exercise of data extraction and exploration utilizing a JSON data source**

# Take Home Data Challenges
## [Relax Chalenge]()
## [Ultimate Challenge Parts 1 & 2]()
## [Ultimate Challange Part 3]()

**Key Skills**
* Full Stack Data Scientist

**Relax Challenge** - Defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into a product on three separate days in at least one seven-day period, identify which factors predict future user adoption. You are given two datasets
1. A user table ("takehome_users") with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the product in the last two years
2. A usage summary table ("takehome_user_engagement") that has a row for each day that a user logged into the product.

**Ultimate Challenge** 
* Part   1  ‐ Exploratory data analysis 
* Part 2  ‐ Experiment   and   metrics   design 
* Part 3 - Predictive Modelling
